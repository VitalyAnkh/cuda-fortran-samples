This directory contains all the example programs which are included in
the NVIDIA HPC SDK package.  The examples are organized by feature, with
examples for each feature contained in a seperate subdirectory.

Following is a list of the files in this directory:

  README             This file

  AutoPar            Directory containing auto parallelization examples

  CUDA-Fortran       Directory containing CUDA Fortran examples

  F2003              Directory containing Fortran 2003 examples

  MPI                Directory containing MPI examples

  OpenACC            Directory containing OpenACC examples

  OpenMP             Directory containing OpenMP examples


To build and run the examples within one of these subdirectories using
the 64-bit compilers on a specific <target> (i.e. Linux_x86_64,
Linux_ppc64le, Linux_aarch64, Windows_x86_64), for example, do the
following:

% cd /my/work/dir
% cp -r <path_to_nvhpc>/<target>/2021/examples/AutoPar .
% cd AutoPar

At this point make sure that the compilers are defined within your
path. This can be done using either your shell syntax or by using the
modulefiles included in this release.

% export PATH=<path_to_nvhpc>/<target>/2021/compilers/bin:$PATH
OR
% module load nvhpc/21.3

Now build/run all the tests within the AutoPar subdirectory using the
following command.

% make NTHREADS=4 all

To get further instructions about building/running the tests within one
of the subdirectories type "make" without any arguments.
Typing make will build and run all SDK examples. An individual SDK
example can be built and run by specifying it as the target to make.
For example to build and run just the vectorAdd SDK example, type:

% make vectorAdd
